ðŸ‘‹! Emily here.
------
I'm an emerging Deaf data scientist with a background in a wide variety of areas including government, accessibility, and research. Right now, I'm pursuing my MS in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), building on my BA in Government (and a minor in Data Science) from Gallaudet University. I enjoy working with Python, SQL, and R (and sometimes a little bit of Java or C) to take complex numbers/data into something meaningful (practical or impractical!)

My experience includes both industry and academic work; from building an image-labeling app and deep learning workflows at Dow Chemical, to developing transcription pipelines, GIS dashboards, and web-based tools with organizations like Nagish, 5 Star Interpreting, and ASL Aspire. I also created an original project from scratch with my undergraduate Honors Capstone at Gallaudet University, where I used ArcGIS to visualize spatial trends in the US Deaf community -- this resulted in a research paper that was archived by both Gallaudet and RIT libraries. 

As you can see, a lot of my work centers on accessibility and Deaf communities. Being a product of the Deaf community (I have Deaf parents and went to four different Deaf K-12 schools) have ingrained in me the importance of community. To stay connected & give back, I work in RIT's Department of Access Services as an ASL Consultant, volunteer with Deaf Kids Code, and try to get involved with various other Deaf organizations/events (I was a Deaf Volleyball Association referee in spring 2025). 

Outside of academics or data, you can find me always taking on whatever that strikes up my fancy. I play on RIT's women's club volleyball team, after more than a decade of playing competitively at the school/club and NCAA Division III levels. I've also recently picked up pickleball so I could challenge myself at something new! I also enjoy getting outside -- hiking, camping, or taking my beloved 23-year-old 4Runner on the road. A lot of times, thereâ€™s really no plan behind what I do or create, but isnâ€™t that the point? 

This site is a small corner of the internet mixing both my professional and personal worlds: professional projects, personal writing, and creative stuff. Feel free to explore, and reach out anytime through my contact page.
